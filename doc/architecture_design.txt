Particle Swarm Optimization Library Architecture Design
Our Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) library architecture is meticulously designed to meet core objectives. This Python-based library aims to solve real-valued optimization problems of varying dimensions, emphasizing modularity, usability, flexibility, and visualization.

Modularity is central to our design. Key components, including Particle, Swarm, Fitness Function, Optimizer, Initializer, Metrics Calculator, and Visualizer, are encapsulated within separate modules or classes. This modular approach enables customization and experimentation with diverse PSO variants.

Usability is a priority. Clear and concise documentation will empower users to swiftly grasp the library's functionality. Detailed usage examples will facilitate its application to specific optimization problems.

Flexibility is crucial. The library is designed to handle a wide range of real-valued optimization problems with minimal customization. Users can configure PSO variants and optimization settings with ease, adapting the library to their unique requirements.

Visualization is essential. Our design incorporates a visual component to generate metrics diagrams, crucial for understanding and analyzing optimization runs.

The Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagram illustrates the architecture, while documentation includes clear, informative comments for each module or class, supported by usage examples.

Team contributions are documented, showcasing the collaborative effort invested in this project.

Our design is rooted in the need for adaptability, user-friendliness, and extensibility. The library offers a user-centric, versatile, and well-documented solution for researchers and practitioners. It is poised to provide flexibility for diverse optimization problems, aligning with the assignment's objectives and serving as a foundation for future enhancements.

In conclusion, our architecture design prioritizes modularity, usability, flexibility, and visualization in a concise, user-focused PSO library, making it a valuable tool for solving real-valued optimization problems.
