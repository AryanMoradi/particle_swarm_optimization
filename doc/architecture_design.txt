# Particle Swarm Optimization Library Architecture Design

## Introduction

This document outlines the architecture design for the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) library, a critical component of our group assignment. Our goal is to create a versatile, extensible, and well-documented library in Python for solving real-valued optimization problems of varying dimensions. This architecture design provides a roadmap for designing a library capable of implementing standard PSO and exploring various PSO variants.

## Objectives

Our architecture is driven by a set of key objectives:

1. **Modularity**: The library will follow a modular design, where each component is encapsulated within a separate module or class. This modularity facilitates extensibility, customization, and the ability to easily swap out components to experiment with different PSO variants.

2. **Usability**: We aim to create a library that is user-friendly and accessible to researchers and practitioners. Clear and concise documentation will be provided for each module, ensuring users can quickly understand the library's functionality.

3. **Flexibility**: The library will allow users to tackle a wide range of real-valued optimization problems without extensive customization. Different PSO variants and optimization parameters will be easily configurable.

4. **Visualization**: To aid in understanding and analyzing optimization runs, we will implement a visual component for generating metrics diagrams. These diagrams will provide insights into the progress and performance of the PSO algorithm.

## Key Components

The core components of our PSO library include Particle, Swarm, Fitness Function, Optimizer, Initializer, Metrics Calculator, and Visualizer. Each component plays a crucial role in the optimization process, and their interaction is orchestrated to achieve the library's objectives.

## Modular Design

The modularity of the library is at the heart of our design. Each component is responsible for a specific aspect of the PSO algorithm, making the library easy to understand and maintain. This modularity ensures that users can readily adapt and extend the library to suit their specific optimization problems.

## Unified Modelling Language (UML) Diagram

To provide a visual representation of our library's architecture, we will create a Unified Modelling Language (UML) diagram. This diagram will illustrate the relationships between the key components and their interactions, helping users and developers comprehend the library's structure.


## Documentation

Documentation is a crucial aspect of our design. Each module or class within the library will be meticulously documented with clear and informative comments. Additionally, detailed usage examples will be provided to guide users in applying the library to their optimization problems.

## Rationale

Our architecture design is grounded in the need for flexibility, usability, and extensibility. By creating a modular and well-documented PSO library, we aim to offer a valuable tool for solving real-valued optimization problems. Researchers and practitioners in various fields will benefit from the library's flexibility, ease of use, and ability to experiment with different PSO variants and optimization settings.

This architecture design ensures that our library aligns with the assignment's objectives, making it a foundation for future enhancements and a valuable asset in the realm of particle swarm optimization.
