The analysis of the provided graphs reveals interesting insights into the performance and behavior of the Standard Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm.
In the "Best Fitness vs Iterations" graph, it is evident that Run 8 outperforms the other runs by consistently improving its fitness value. Starting with the highest fitness value of 20.2, Run 8 gradually converges to 19.9 after 25 iterations. This indicates that Run 8 potentially discovers a better solution compared to the other runs, which maintain relatively stable fitness values ranging from 19.0 to 19.9.
The "Distance to Global Optimum vs Iterations" graph provides valuable information about the convergence behavior of the swarm. Run 8 exhibits a unique pattern, initially exploring a larger search space by starting 40 units away from the global optimum, then increasing to 80, and finally converging back to 0 after 15 iterations. On the other hand, the remaining runs start with distances ranging from 30 to 50 units and converge to 0 within 10 to 20 iterations. This suggests that Run 8 explores different regions before eventually converging to the global optimum.
The "Standard Deviation of Particle Positions vs Iterations" graph highlights the variability in particle positions around the swarm center of mass. Run 8 stands out once again, showing distinct behavior with a standard deviation of 10.0 initially, increasing to 20.0, and rapidly decreasing to 0 at 13 iterations. In contrast, Runs 2, 5, 8, and 10 achieve a standard deviation of 0, indicating a more focused and concentrated swarm around the global optimum. The other runs converge to standard deviation values between 7.5 and 10. This suggests that Runs 2, 5, 8, and 10 achieve better convergence and localization around the global optimum.
Lastly, the "Mean Velocity vs Iterations" graph demonstrates the average velocity of particles in the swarm. All runs start with mean velocities around 10-12 and gradually increase to 25-35 by 15 iterations. Notably, Run 8 exhibits a higher mean velocity, reaching 50 at 15 iterations. This indicates that Run 8 possesses better exploration and exploitation capabilities, allowing it to cover a larger search space and potentially find better solutions.
In conclusion, the analysis of these graphs provides valuable insights into the performance and behavior of the Standard PSO algorithm. Run 8 consistently outperforms the other runs in terms of fitness values, convergence behavior, and exploration capabilities. These findings can guide further improvements or adjustments to enhance the algorithm's performance.
