The "Best Fitness vs Iterations" graph shows the fitness values achieved by each run over iterations. Run 8 stands out as it starts with the highest fitness value of 20.2 and gradually improves to 19.9 after 25 iterations. Other runs exhibit varying fitness values, with some staying relatively constant (e.g., run 1 at 19.0) and others showing slight improvements (e.g., run 5 at 19.5). This indicates that the runs exhibit variability in their convergence behavior for different initializations.
The "Distance to Global Optimum vs Iterations" graph provides insights into how close each run gets to the global optimum. Run 8, once again, exhibits distinct behavior by starting at 40 units away from the global optimum, increasing to 80, and then converging back to 0 after 15 iterations. In contrast, the other runs start at distances ranging from 30 to 50 units and converge to 0 within 10 to 20 iterations. This suggests that while the whole swarm generally converges towards the global optimum, the convergence patterns and distances vary among the runs.
The "Standard Deviation of Particle Positions vs Iterations" graph represents the variability in particle positions around the swarm center of mass. Run 8 stands out as an outlier, starting with a standard deviation of 10.0, increasing to 20.0, and rapidly decreasing to 0 at 13 iterations. Runs 2, 5, 10, and 8 are the only ones that reach a standard deviation of 0, indicating a more focused and concentrated swarm. Other runs start with standard deviations ranging from 10 to 12.5 and gradually decrease to 7.5-10. This suggests that the swarm exhibits different levels of exploration and exploitation capabilities, leading to variations in convergence behavior.
The "Mean Velocity vs Iterations" graph shows the average velocity of particles in the swarm. All runs start with mean velocities around 10-12 and gradually increase to 25-35 by 15 iterations. Run 8 stands out again, reaching a mean velocity of 50 at 15 iterations. This indicates that Run 8 possesses better exploration and exploitation capabilities, allowing it to cover a larger search space and potentially find better solutions.
In conclusion, the analysis of these graphs reveals that the runs exhibit variability in their convergence behavior for different initializations. While the whole swarm generally converges towards the global optimum, the convergence patterns, distances to the global optimum, and exploration capabilities vary among the runs. Run 8 consistently stands out with better fitness values, larger exploration, and higher mean velocity. These findings highlight the importance of considering multiple runs and different initializations to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the algorithm's performance.
